👋 Hi, I’m @RiskTaker1119  
🎓 I hold a Master of Finance (MFin) from SUSTech and currently work as a Quantitative Researcher at a hedge fund managing over 100B+ AUM.  
👀 I’m deeply interested in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and software development.  
🌱 I’m currently advancing my skills in C++ and exploring machine learning techniques for developing robust trading strategies.  
💡 I’m proficient in mainstream programming languages such as C++ and Python, and I have extensive experience in developing strategies on both domestic quantitative platforms (MyQuant, JoinQuant, QMT) and international platforms (MT4/5, TradingView, OKX API).  
📊 My research covers a wide range of assets, including Chinese A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, Chinese futures, international futures, and cryptocurrency quant trading.  
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on financial modeling, quantitative research projects, and open-source trading algorithms.  
📫 Feel free to reach out to me at: crazyquant@tutamail.com
