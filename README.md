👾 Hi, I’m @RiskTaker1119  
🚀 Master of Finance (MFin) from SUSTech and currently a Quantitative Researcher at a hedge fund with over 100B+ AUM.  
📈 My strategies consistently deliver an impressive annualized return of 30%, supported by rigorous risk management and data-driven decision-making.  
⚙️ Proficient in C++, Python, and experienced in developing strategies on leading domestic platforms (MyQuant, JoinQuant, QMT...) as well as international platforms (MT4/5, TradingView, OKX API...).  
🌐 My research spans across various markets including Chinese A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, Chinese futures, international futures, and cryptocurrency quant trading.  
🔥 An ardent fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, I draw inspiration from the series' intricate strategies and unpredictable twists in crafting my own trading approaches.
